# Island Grid
Island Grid is an Island Visualizer Tool.


Click on any part of the blue grid to generate an island.
Click on a section of land to turn it back into an ocean.

Change the number of rows and columns in your island by entering a number in the rows and columns sections.
Alternatively, press the '+' and '-' buttons to increase or decrease the number of rows or columns.

## Deleting a row or column removes landmass permanently!

Landmasses joined vertically or horizontally are considered one island (but not diagonally).

The Island Counter will update as you make changes to the grid of islands or by deleting rows and columns.
